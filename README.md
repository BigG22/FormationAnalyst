# FormationAnalyst

Hi, 

Most importantly - Thank you very much for checking out this software! This is my first ever attempt at publishing any type of code so I appreciate anyone who sees this, that little bit extra!

This app recommends a formation that you can use, based on your squad depth, in Football Manager!

This is Version 1.0. Version 0.1 was a pre-release version - simply a bunch of code being inputted, and outputted in a terminal. 
    - The main addition in Version 1.0 is the GUI. 

    - Along with this came the addition of the Feedback Report. This is a dedicated section within the programme where it can tell you a bit more 
      about why it chose the specific formation.
 
    - Another minor update includes improvements to the logic of the programme.

This software is definitely aimed at easing that feeling of being completely overwhelmed by the game, when you first start playing it as a Football Manager newcomer. Hopefully this will help you on your way to success in your first save/s.

Thanks again for trying this out. If you have any feedback, please direct it my way!
